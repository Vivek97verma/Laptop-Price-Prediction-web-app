# Laptop-Price-Prediction-web-app
This project involved developing a predictive model to estimate laptop prices based on various features. The dataset included attributes such as company, type, RAM, weight, price, touchscreen capability, IPS panel, CPU brand, HDD, SSD, GPU brand, and operating system. The goal was to build a model that accurately predicts laptop prices, providing valuable insights for potential buyers and sellers.

Tools Used:

Python: Utilized for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development. Libraries like Pandas and NumPy were used for data manipulation, while Scikit-Learn was employed for building and evaluating the predictive model.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for documenting the analysis, running code, and visualizing results.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Applied for data visualization, helping to identify trends and relationships in the dataset.

Key Outcomes:

Developed a robust predictive model with high accuracy in estimating laptop prices.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature importance and relationships.
Implemented feature engineering techniques to improve model performance and interpretability.
